# Mathematics for Machine Learning Course Repository
This repository contains materials and examples related to the Mathematics for Machine Learning course. It includes implementations of Eigenfaces algorithms, exercises from the book "Learning from Data," as well as two implementations: one for SVM with test vs. validation graphs, and another with various methods (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) optimized using grid search and evaluated with cross-validation.

## Repository Contents
1. Eigenfaces Implementations: You will find implementations of Eigenfaces algorithms used in face recognition and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

2. Exercises from "Learning from Data" Book: This section includes solved exercises and practical examples based on the "Learning from Data" book, which covers fundamental concepts in machine learning.

3. Custom SVM Implementation: A custom implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is provided. This implementation is built from scratch, allowing you to understand the inner workings of the SVM algorithm.

4. Multiple Methods Implementation Optimized with GridSearch and Evaluated with Cross-Validation: This section includes an implementation that uses GridSearch to optimize parameters for different methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. These methods are evaluated using cross-validation to obtain robust performance estimates.
